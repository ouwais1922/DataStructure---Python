### Data Structure ###

Data structure: A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program or system so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Examples of common data structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

## LinkedList
A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in a series of nodes, each of which contains a reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence. In other words, each node contains a piece of data and a reference to the next node in the list.
## LinkedList && Arrays

    1- Memory allocation: In an array, memory is allocated in a contiguous block, which means that each element is stored in a fixed memory location. In contrast, a linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, where each element is stored in a separate memory location, connected by pointers.

    2- Size: The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation and cannot be changed. In contrast, a linked list can grow or shrink in size dynamically, as new elements are added or removed.

    3- Insertion and deletion: Inserting or deleting elements in an array can be slow, especially if the array is large, since it requires shifting all the elements after the insertion point. In contrast, inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is generally faster, since it only requires changing a few pointers to re-link the list.
